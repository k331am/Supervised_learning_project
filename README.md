CU Boulder Supervised Learning Final Project

This repository contains the jupyter notebook used to generate the pdf submitted for the supervised learning final project.

If you want to try running the code yourself, keep in mind that it may take quite a while (30 minutes or more) for some cells if you are not using a work station.

Also keep in mind that some parameters within the code may need downscaling if you do not have enough RAM
